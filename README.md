Welcome! I am Xiangqing Wang (王湘晴 in Chinese), currently a PhD student at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. I obtained my Bachelor’s degrees in Economics and Statistics from the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics (WISE), Xiamen University. 

My research interests lie in spatial economics, urban economics, and labor economics.
