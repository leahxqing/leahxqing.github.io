# ReadMe
This is the **ReadMe** file for **Time Series Analysis** course in the minor program of the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics by Xiangqing Wang (王湘晴).

This folder contains all files for this project (**Weather Prediction Based on ARIMA, RNN and Prophet**). 

### Code
  - Code from `R` for **data description**, **ARIMA**, **Prophet**:
    Since I directly write the slides and report by `rmarkdown` and execute the code together, you can either find my relevant code from `./slides/slides.rmd` file or `./report/report.rmd` file.
  - Code from `Python` for **RNN**
    I use python jupyter notebook to run the **RNN** fitting and forecast. You can find my relevant code from `./code_rnn/code.ipynb` file.

### Other Explanantions
- data 
  - This folder contains the raw data from NOAA for whole China from 2017 to 2022 (`1942-2024年我国观测站点的逐日气象指标（来源于NOAA）`) and only **Shenyang**'s data (`shenyang`) per year.
  - The `data.csv` file is the final data to use.
- fig
  - This folder contains some figures to be added into slides and report.

### For `github`
- I only show the `RNN` code in python as well as the `data` file. If you have interest on the code of `Prophet` or `ARIMA`, you could directly the slides or report. If you have further need, please feel free to contact me through email (wangxq2003@gmail.com).
