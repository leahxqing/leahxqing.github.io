# ReadMe
This is the **ReadMe** file for **Time Series Analysis** course in the minor program of the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics by Xiangqing Wang (王湘晴).

This folder contains all files for this project (**Weather Prediction Based on ARIMA, RNN and Prophet**). 

### For `github`
- I only show the `RNN` code in python as well as the `data` file. If you have interest on the code of `Prophet` or `ARIMA`, you could directly read the slides or report. If you have further need, please feel free to contact me through email (wangxq2003@gmail.com).
