# ReadMe

This is the **ReadMe** file for **Time Series Analysis** course in the minor program of the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics by Xiangqing Wang (王湘晴).

This folder contains all files for this project (**Weather Prediction Based on ARIMA, RNN and Prophet**). 

## For `Github`
- I only show the `RNN` code in python as well as the `data` file. If you are interested in the `Prophet` or `ARIMA` code, you could directly read the slides or report. If you have further needs, feel free to contact me through email (wangxq2003@gmail.com).
- The raw data is from NOAA for the whole of China from 2017 to 2022 and here I only include **Shenyang** following my project.
