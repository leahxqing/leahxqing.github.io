My research interests lie in spatial economics, urban economics, and labor economics. Iâ€™m always open to discussions and collaborationsâ€”please feel free to reach out via email ([xqwang.econ@gmail.com](mailto:xqwang.econ@gmail.com), [xiangqing.wang@rotman.utoronto.ca](mailto:xiangqing.wang@rotman.utoronto.ca)) if you have any questions or ideas youâ€™d like to share.
