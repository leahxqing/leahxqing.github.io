Welcome! I am Xiangqing Wang (çŽ‹æ¹˜æ™´), an incoming PhD student at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Economics and Statistics from the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics (WISE), Xiamen University.

My research interests lie in spatial economics, urban economics, and labor economics. Iâ€™m open to discussions, collaborations, and new ideasâ€”please feel free to reach out via email if youâ€™d like to connect!
