Hello! Iâ€™m Xiangqing Wang (çŽ‹æ¹˜æ™´), an incoming PhD student at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics and Statistics at the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics (WISE), Xiamen University. My research interests broadly lie in spatial economics, urban economics, and labor economics. Iâ€™m open to discussions, collaborations, and new ideasâ€”please feel free to reach out via email if youâ€™d like to connect!
